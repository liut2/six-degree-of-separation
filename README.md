six-degree-of-separation
========================

This is a program I wrote in Java to apply the concept of six degree of separation in the film industry. The program functions in this way: the user can input two actor/actress's name and the program will analyze and draw a chart to show the connections between these two people. That is to say, the program will find the movies that they cast if they appear in the same movie; otherwise, the program will use a chain to connect them with other actors/actresses who cast in the same movie with them. The data I use is from iMDB.
