six-degree-of-separation
========================

This is a program I wrote in Java to apply the concept of six degree of separation in the film industry. The program functions in this way: the user can input two actress's name and the program will analyze and draw a chart to show the connections between these two people. That is to say, the program will find the movies that they cast in if they appear in the same movie; otherwise, the program will use a chain to connect them with other actresses who cast in the same movie with them. The data I use is from iMDB open source database and can be downloaded here.

When you run the program, remember to upzip the data and put them in the same directory as the java code.
